Revise and learn new things from the incredible book Pro MERN Stack 2 by Vasan Subramanian.

Differencies in technologies used(I think it's interesting to migrate from technologies used in the book initially to other ones to start learning/revising them):
1. React hooks instead of classes
However, due to javascript class based approach to create react components is deprecated, I'm using react components created as JS functions and hooks, which is now the most modern way to achieve react programming.

2. MySQL server instead of MongoDB
Because of sanctions Russians can no longer make requests to MongoDB. So, switched to MySQL in this application. And I'll try DynamoDB since it's another NoSQL db, other than MongoDB, which I want to experience.
